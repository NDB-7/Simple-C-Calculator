# Simple C Calculator
A very basic C integer calculator with a log.

(NOTE: You must have GCC installed to compile the file. A file named log.txt will be created in the folder in which you compile and run the file. Run `gcc Calculator.c` in the directory then `./a.out` to execute the file, execute it as many times as you want and the log will simply grow.)
